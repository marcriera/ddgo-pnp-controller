## Usage

Connect the Plug & Play to a PC or console using the data cable. Press one of the following button combinations to select the controller you want to emulate:

| Controller                              | Button combination       | Notes                                            |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| One handle controller (Nintendo Switch) | UP                       | SELECT+START=HOME, SELECT+LEFT=L, SELECT+RIGHT=R |
| Two handle controller (PC)              | RIGHT                    | D-Pad is mapped to SELECT+ABCD                   |
| Two handle controller (PS1)             | DOWN + Power handle at 0 | Hold D to disable handles and enable D-Pad       |
| Two handle controller "Type 2" (PS2)    | D                        |                                                  |
| Shinkansen controller (PS2)             | B                        | Power notches are mapped to P2-P4-P7-P10-P13     |
| Multi Train Controller (PS2) - P4/B7    | C + Power handle at 0    | SELECT+A=A2, SELECT+D=ATS, SELECT+D-Pad=Reverser |
| Multi Train Controller (PS2) - P4/B2-B7 | C + Power handle at 1    | SELECT+A=A2, SELECT+D=ATS, SELECT+D-Pad=Reverser |
| Multi Train Controller (PS2) - P5/B5    | C + Power handle at 2    | SELECT+A=A2, SELECT+D=ATS, SELECT+D-Pad=Reverser |
| Multi Train Controller (PS2) - P5/B7    | C + Power handle at 3    | SELECT+A=A2, SELECT+D=ATS, SELECT+D-Pad=Reverser |
| Generic Train Controller                | A                        |                                                  |

Hold the buttons until the controller vibrates to confirm selection. If no button is pressed, you can play with the Plug & Play as usual.

If you need more information regarding each controller and supported software, please check the [Densha de GO! controller documentation](https://marcriera.github.io/ddgo-controller-docs).

## RNDIS access (advanced users)

When no controller is selected, RNDIS access is enabled in the device. You can access SSH on the Plug & Play at 169.254.215.100. SFTP is not supported out of the box, but SCP is available. Keep in mind the root filesystem is mounted read-only by default.

## Notes

- During the first installation, if no previous mods are detected, the device's original kernel is backed up to a folder named *BACKUP* in the root of the USB drive. Copy its contents to a safe location.
- If detected, the [original mod by GMMan](https://github.com/GMMan/dengo-plug-and-play-controller) will be uninstalled to avoid conflicts.

## Compilation

To compile the program yourself, you will need Rust and toolchain for Armv7-A. The easiest way is to install [cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) and run:

```cross build --target arm-unknown-linux-musleabi --release```

The Linux kernel source can be found [here](https://github.com/MarcRiera/dengo-plug-and-play-kernel).
